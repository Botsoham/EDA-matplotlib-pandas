# 📊 Data Analysis with Pandas & Visualization with Matplotlib

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to use **Pandas** for data analysis and **Matplotlib/Seaborn** for data visualization.  
We analyze a dataset of employees, calculate statistics such as **average salary and experience**, and generate different visualizations:
- Bar Chart
- Scatter Plot
- Heatmap

The goal is to understand data patterns and provide meaningful **insights**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas 📑
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 🎨

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset is created within the Python script itself, containing **50 employees** with the following attributes:
- **EmployeeID** – Unique ID  
- **Name** – Employee name  
- **Age** – Employee age  
- **Department** – IT, HR, Finance, or Marketing  
- **Salary** – Monthly salary  
- **Experience** – Work experience in years  

---

## 📈 Analysis & Visualizations
1. **Basic Analysis**
   - Dataset info, missing values, and summary statistics
   - Average Salary and Average Experience  

2. **Visualizations**
   - 📊 **Bar Chart** – Average Salary by Department  
   - ⚪ **Scatter Plot** – Age vs Salary  
   - 🔥 **Heatmap** – Correlation between numerical features  
   - 🎨 **Scatter Plot (colored)** – Experience vs Salary by Department  

3. **Insights**
   - IT and Finance departments have higher salaries compared to HR and Marketing.  
   - Strong positive correlation between **Experience** and **Salary**.  
   - Younger employees tend to earn less, while experienced employees in Finance/IT earn more.
